## CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

1. problemStatementList.md contains our stock of problem statements, so make sure to check that before contributing a problem solution.

2. Creating an issue: 

   **Format:** <Adding/Updating> '\<Name of problem statement>'

   *Example:* Adding 'Longest Palindromic Substring'

3. You are free to explore other issues, which need attention, like issues with ***help wanted*** label with no ***assignee***.

4. Kindly try to always get to work after the issue has been assigned to you.

5. In case if you're adding a new problem statement, the PR must contain 3 file changes. 2 new files, *Solution.java* and *README.md* for the aforementioned problem statement. These two files need to be in a folder as \<Topic>/\<Name of problem statement>/. If the folder for a particular *topic* is not already present, you are free to create one. The Solution.java may or may not have a main method. The README.md for the problem statement should contain the Leetcode link, problem statement, detailed solution approach, and, time and space complexity analysis. You also need to update the problem statement in the *problemStatementList.md*.

6. A few things to keep in mind: It doesn't matter if the solution is not yours. Code must be clean and understandable, also properly documented.

7. Wait for the PR to be reviewed, and make necessary changes if requested.
